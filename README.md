# UI Assignments in Python

# Description
The second assignment is a Zen garden where a monk rakes his garden. He can only go horizontally or vertically, never diagonally. It always starts at the edge of the garden and pulls a straight strip to the other edge or to an obstacle. On the edge - outside the garden, he can walk as he wants.

I used a classic genetic alogrithm with set number of generations and genes. These genes mutate and produce new ones.

The third assignment is a clustering algorithm using K-means clustering with centroids and medoids.
